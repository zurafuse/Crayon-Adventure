## How to Play

* Open the game by visiting the demo [here](http://zurafuse.com/crayondungeon/), or clone/download this repository and open index.html.
* Use Arrow keys to move (or on-screen buttons). Use the space bar or on-screen circle button to attack with your sword.
* Defeat enemies by striking them. Don't let them touch you. When you collide with a bad guy or bullet, your health decreases. If you lose all of your health, the game resets and you will need to start from the begining.
* Collect power-ups to get through obstacles, starting with your sword. To beat the game, collect all of the gems to break the Gem seals, find the Plunger of Justice, defeat Super Toilet, and obtain the Octaforce.
